**Capstone Letter of Intent (LOI)**

**II. Project Overview**

* **Capstone Project Name/Idea:** SquidPool  
* **Brief Project Description:** SquidPool is a decentralized no-loss lottery or decentralized prize savings application where users get to keep their initial deposit amount after the lottery prize is drawn. Instead of funding the prize money using the lottery tickets purchased, the prize money is funded using the interest earned on Compound by the pooled user deposits.  
* **Reason for Choosing this Project**: I am trying to follow the principle of small wins. I have many project ideas, but right now my skill set is not enough to create a platform where you can trade or create collaterals based on your phantom tokens/equity for employers, or to create a platform with crypto-bounties and token loyalty programs (social rating) for open source developers. It looks like right now there are not many no-loss (staking) lotteries on Solana. Plus this functionality is the necessary basis for any possible extension (e.g. gamification with elements in a style of "Squid Game" where participants can vote after every game round to split the prize pool).

**III. Go-to-Market Strategy**

* **Target Audience:**  
  * DeFi users looking for low-risk yield opportunities with lottery-like upside  
  * Traditional savings account holders who want to explore DeFi but are hesitant about losing principal  
  * Solana ecosystem participants interested in new DeFi products  
  * Crypto-curious users who enjoy lottery/gaming mechanics but want capital preservation  
* **Value Proposition:**  
  * Zero risk of losing initial deposit \- users can withdraw their full deposit amount anytime  
  * Potential to win significant prizes funded by pooled interest yields  
  * Future gamification potential with Squid Game-style mechanics  
* **Marketing and Distribution:**  
  * Online advertising (targeting industry publications and websites)  
  * Social media campaigns (engaging with relevant communities on Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)  
  * Content marketing (creating blog posts, articles, and whitepapers about decentralized advertising, educational content explaining the no-loss lottery concept)  
  * Partnerships with advertising agencies and publishers  
  * Community-first approach through Solana Discord communities and Twitter  
  * Partnerships with existing Solana DeFi protocols for cross-promotion  
  * Potential airdrops/rewards for early adopters  
* **Competitive Landscape:**   
  * Similar concepts on other chains (PoolTogether on Ethereum)  
  * Differentiators: Solana's low fees, fast transactions, and future gamification elements  
  * WIP

**IV. Technical Details**

* **Tech Stack:**  
  * Blockchain Platform: Solana  
  * Smart Contract Language: Anchor/Rust  
  * Backend: Rust, actix-web  
  * NFT Standard: (?)  
  * Front-End Framework: React (v0.dev)  
  * Database: WIP   
  * Oracle: (?)  
* **Smart Contract Development:**  
  * Anchor will be used for smart contract development, ensuring compatibility with the Solana ecosystem.  
  * Testing: Unit testing, integration testing, and security audits will be conducted to ensure the reliability and security of the smart contracts.

**V. Conclusion**

* **Project Timeline:** User Stories: Jan 28, Arc Diagram: Feb 6th, Devnet: Feb 21st  
* **Commitment:** I am committed:) Honestly, I don't know what to respond to in this section, my goal is in the intersection of launching a product, learning new things and sharing the results with the community. In case of failure I will prepare an article and will open source the solution to facilitate further possible invariants of this idea by the community.
